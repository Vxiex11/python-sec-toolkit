This repository houses a comprehensive and growing collection of Python scripts and projects dedicated to exploring fundamental concepts in network programming, cybersecurity analysis, and application defense.

The tools are designed primarily for educational use and auditing your own infrastructure, providing practical, hands-on implementations of various security principles.

This repository is organized into three main pillars: Secure Communication, Offensive Auditing, and Defensive Mitigation.

1. Secure Communication & Cryptography

Projects focused on implementing core cryptographic techniques to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
E2E Encrypted Chatbox: A proof-of-concept application demonstrating the implementation of end-to-end (E2E) encryption to guarantee message privacy and integrity in communications.

2. Offensive Network Discovery & Auditing

In the future, I will put some scripts about this specific topic.

A series of projects focused on understanding and mapping network topology, emphasizing legal and ethical use for self-auditing and penetration testing preparation

Web & Application Defense (Future Focus)
(This section will be populated with scripts and configurations focused on defensive security and hardening applications.)

[!] Ethical & Legal Disclaimer

All tools are provided strictly for educational and self-auditing purposes. Users are responsible for adhering to all applicable local, national, and international laws.
Unauthorized use against third-party networks or systems is strictly prohibited. I do not condone or support any illegal or unethical use of these tools.

Getting Started
Most projects in this repository are written in Python 3.
Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Vxiex11/python-sec-toolkit

Install dependencies:
Navigate to the specific project folder you wish to explore. Dependencies (like Scapy or cryptography libraries) can usually be installed using the requirements.txt file within that directory.
Bash

cd [your_project_folder]

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script:

python [script_name].py
